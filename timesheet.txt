- Study / test SessionEmulation_1_0
This task allows a user to emulate into another Pseudo City Code (PCC) within a session. After emulation, the user in effect becomes a user in that Pseudo City and can manipulate data for the Pseudo City. This task is typically used by Service Bureau Agents to perform duties for multiple Pseudo City Code accounts.
