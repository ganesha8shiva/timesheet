Queue process calls for Galileo integrated in QILive and syc up same with git hub and the copy GDS.dll 
- Deploy same copy on oakland server
- GDS.dll module has been deployed

Getting fimiliar with QITransform 
Amadeus Transform started a while back

a really big task is going to be getting the Amadeus Transform we started a while back working with Pipeline...

Familiarize yourself with the QITransform Project to gain better understanding of what we're trying to do and continue building the 1A.xslt file



- AddItiremark under GlileoCliant , make changes in following file / section
- GDS / GalileoClient
- Tested the by calling same function at the end of authentication

private string AddItinRemarks(string remark, string from_queue, string to_queue, string PCC)

- remark
- from_queue (from where pnr will retrieve)
- to_queue (where pnr will pushed after remark)
- pcc
- Function will add remark to all pnrs in queue


- WSQueue changes in QILive
- Changes in GetQueuedItems to pull PNRs from queue
- Getxml() return empty instance of XmlDocument() if PNR are listed in 
- Move UtidDB.InsertBooking() from WSClient to WSQueue
- WSQueue to store Default Form,Company,Team,Region & Market settings
- Create config settings and necessary code for WSQueue to do so

- Study / test SessionEmulation_1_0
This task allows a user to emulate into another Pseudo City Code (PCC) within a session. After emulation, the user in effect becomes a user in that Pseudo City and can manipulate data for the Pseudo City. This task is typically used by Service Bureau Agents to perform duties for multiple Pseudo City Code accounts.

Issue Overview (ID: 3231) 
Hello,

the flight duration for an offer is currently displayed in format "0230" in the document.
For an active segment you display flight duration in format "02.30".
(In the mock up we requested the display to be in format "02:30")

Please change the display for flight duration of offers to format "02.30", just like in the itinerary display, or "02:30" if we need to keep what has been requested in the mock up.

Thanks, Johanna 



Issue Overview (ID: 3230) 
Hello,

when the number of stops for an offer is zero, you display number "0" in the document.
For an active segment you display the words "Non Stop" in the document.

Please change the display for offers to wording "Non Stop" when number of stops is zero, just like in the itinerary display. Please also see mock ups.

Thanks, Johanna
